Instructions on how to get it to work.

It all started with Makerbase's GitHub.

https://github.com/makerbase-mks/Klipper-for-MKS-Boards/tree/main/MKS%20Robin%20Pro%20V1.x

There I found the standard printer.cfg for the Artist D Pro.   
The file "generic-mks-robin-pro-v1.cfg" Includes instructions on how to create the Klipper firmware.          

I still had an old laptop lying in the corner.        
I then installed Ubuntu Server on it. But any other Linux or a Raspberry Pi should also work.        
The SSH server should be enabled on the host system.        
So let the fun begin.        
First of all, get the KIAHU script. https://github.com/dw-0/kiauh                
Instruction for installation can be found on the KIAUH GitHub.                        
This makes everything easy to install.                
We need Klipper, Moonraker and Mainsail.                
The script is self-explanatory, so install all 3 please.   

So far, everything went smoothly. But how do you do that with the firmware for the printer?        
So you can use the "Robin_pro35 v0.10.0-557.bin" from the GitHub... and just rename it to Robin_pro35.bin.        
Flash to the printer and you're done.
Alternativly you can build your own Firmware with the KIAUH script.

Confusing was the  "...booting" Message in the display of the printer ... and nothing happens.        
Don't worry, it's normal.        
The display will no longer work!        

Now we should somehow be able to access the firmware with the WEB Interface Mainsail.                
So put the USB cable in and connect to the laptop, PI whatever you have to the Printer.  

Great, now we can access Mainsail, which is the Klipper WEB surface.        
So with "http://" your IP "  from your Desktop connect to the Klipper server" (laptop, Raspi ...)"        
If everything worked, you can now see this interface:

On the left-hand side, click on MACHINE

Here you delete the printer.cfg and copy all files from my GitHub repository.

Click RESTART.
If everything worked, the printer should now connect.
If not check your printer.cfg for this section:
                [mcu]
                serial: /dev/serial/by-id/usb-1a86_USB_Serial-if00-port0
this ist your USB port your Printer connectet.

SSH ino your Laptop, Pi.. an type 
```

ls /dev/serial/by-id/

```

and the the shown usb-port.
